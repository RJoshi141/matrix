# Matrix Effect

A Matrix-themed falling text effect created using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, inspired by the iconic visuals from "The Matrix" movie. You can view the live project [here](https://rjoshi141.github.io/matrix/).

## Demo

## Features

- Real-time text falling effect with a Matrix-style green glow.
- Randomly generated characters (Latin and Cyrillic letters).
- Dynamic resizing: Automatically adjusts the canvas size based on the browser window.
- Smooth and efficient rendering for a consistent experience across devices.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering the animated matrix-like effect.
- **JavaScript**: For managing the animation and rendering logic.
- **GitHub Pages**: For deployment and hosting.

## How It Works

The effect is generated by creating multiple "falling characters" that move down the screen at random speeds. Characters are rendered with a fading opacity to create a glowing trail as they fall, mimicking the classic Matrix code rain.

### Code Breakdown:

1. **HTML**: The base structure with a `canvas` element to draw the animation.
2. **JavaScript**:
   - A `FallingChar` class generates random characters that fall vertically.
   - The `update()` function is responsible for continuously refreshing the canvas and drawing new characters as they fall.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/matrix.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd matrix
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the effect locally, or use a tool like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for an even smoother local development experience.
